The Storage Services protocols provide disk and volume management services, data backup and restore, removable media management, encrypted file access control, and file encryption. They support scenarios such as creating/modifying volumes, configuring HBA ports and iSCSI initiators, creating shadow copies, restoring the shadow copies, creating/deleting media pool, mounting/dismounting media, file encryption/decryption, and providing cryptographic access permissions to encrypted files.},
